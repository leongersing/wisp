# Wisp

Once upon a time, I wanted a few functions for my Objective-C work.
I could have easily found someone else's implementations but that
wouldn't have been nearly as fun. This is just some playtime as I 
learn some of the new Obj-C literals
while pulling in some of my favorite stuff from a few of my other favorite
languages. 

Feel free to use it as you like, patch, submit pull requests, etc.
I love to play and if you want to play in my sandbox, the more the merrier. :)
